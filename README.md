# Conways-Game-of-Life
This C++ implementation of Conway's Game of Life simulates cellular evolution on a grid. Cells are either alive ('O') or dead ('.') and evolve based on four rules: underpopulation, overpopulation, reproduction, and survival. The grid can be printed or updated iteratively based on user commands.
